1. Build a Todo app with adding, removing, and toggling items using state.
2. Create a controlled form component with real-time validation.
3. Lift shared state to a common parent and pass props down to siblings.
4. Use Fragments to return multiple sibling elements without wrappers.
5. Optimize a list component by wrapping it with `React.memo`.
